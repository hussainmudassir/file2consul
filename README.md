# file2consul

file2consul takes up a config file and compares it with the config that is already there in consul. The idea is to make sure the config changes which is going to be updated into the consul is desired and then move ahead with build process, otherwise fail the build. 

#### Installation
`npm install -g file2consul`

#### Docker
The docker image can have a run command for file2consul.
